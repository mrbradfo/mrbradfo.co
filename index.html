<!--			Seasons of change. Learning to be okay and hold fast when the seasons change and all looks dry and weary.-->
<!--			It's good that the seasons change. It's good that the leaf falls. Sometimes, it feels like forever, but winter-->
<!--			never lasts forever. Learning to be okay with that and to remember that he is always working.-->



<!--			Trying to relearn the beauty of child like expression, vulnerability, and trust.-->

<!--			As we grow older we grow wiser,-->
<!--			but fear can also grow bigger. We know more about the dark and harmful things in the world and inside ourselves.-->

<!--			Why be vulnerable on a platform that is so toxic. Working on getting a website up where I can be me. Stay tuned.-->

<!--			The road to expression, creativity, and growth is a road of accepting imperfections and limitations.-->
<!--			I have very much limited my creativity by not allowing my self to be perfect or even good at something. I-->
<!--			want to write more, put out my thoughts, share my photos, make videos, make music. A lot of that will not be-->
<!--			very good. At least at first or in the beginning. If I am to be creative I need to learn the childlike vulnerability to-->
<!--			express and fail.-->
